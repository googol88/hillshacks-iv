      <h2>Why come to hillsHacks?</h2>
      <p>Can you spend a day without using some form of technology developed in the last 5 years? It would probably be difficult - technology has completely changed the way we live our lives. Regardless of your experience, you will learn something new at hillsHacks about how computer science is being used all around us - often in things we take for granted! All students grade 6 and up are welcome.</p>

      <h2>Where will the event take place?</h2>
      <p>We're taking hillsHacks virtually this year and will be using Zoom and email as our sole means of communication. Even though we can't physically gather, we'll strive for an authentic experience that retains the spirit of hacking!</p>

      <h2>What if I don’t know anything about coding or computer science?</h2>
      <p>No problem! We highly encourage beginners to come, and our workshops will give you opportunities to learn about fundamental CS concepts. After creating an idea for the design challenge, you'll be ready to implement it on your own!</p>

      <h2>I’m an expert at coding. What do I get out of this event?</h2>
      <p>Take a look at some of our advanced workshops like ___! Also, we recommend you to actively engage during our Panel Q&A session (this applies to beginners too!)</p>
      
      <h2>When do I have to register by?</h2>
      <p>Registration is free and the signup form will remain open until the day of the event. However, we encourage you to sign up early so we can get a better feel of who will be attending.</p>
