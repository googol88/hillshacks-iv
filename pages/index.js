      <Text as="p" sx={{fontSize: 2}} mb={3}><b>hillsHacks was born with a mission:</b> to show that computer science is something anyone can learn. It's more than memorizing technical jargon and stuffing code into machines. CS is for innovators, creators, problem solvers, artists, and <i>you</i>.</Text>
      <Text as="p" sx={{fontSize: 2}} mb={3}>Rather than leave you alone expecting a full-fledged product launch at the end of the day, we'll guide you through the learning process with workshops from Watchung Hills alumni. Plus, we'll provide you one-on-one mentorship and an opportunity to listen in and ask questions about tech during our Panel Q&A session. Deviating from the traditional hackathon, there will be two tracks: code and no-code, with a greater emphasis on ideas and how technology can be used for good.</Text>

          <h2>Why come to hillsHacks?</h2>
          <p>Can you spend a day without using some form of technology developed in the last 5 years? It would probably be difficult - technology has completely changed the way we live our lives. Regardless of your experience, you will learn something new at hillsHacks about how computer science is being used all around us - often in things we take for granted! All students grade 6 and up are welcome.</p>

          <h2>Where and when will the event take place?</h2>
          <p>hillsHacks will run as a hybrid event. Watchung Hills students may attend in-person at the high school or virtually from home, but all other attendees must attend virtually via Zoom. Even though things will be different this year, we'll strive for an authentic experience that retains the spirit of hacking!</p>
          <p>The event will take place on <b>Saturday, June 5, from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.</b></p>

          <h2>What if I don’t know anything about coding or computer science?</h2>
          <p>No problem! We highly encourage beginners to come, and our workshops will give you opportunities to learn about fundamental CS concepts. After creating an idea as part of the no-code hackathon track, you'll be ready to implement it on your own!</p>
